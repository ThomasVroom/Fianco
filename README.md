# Fianco

A small Java-based [Fianco](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/fianco.htm) implementation.

- Must use NegaMax AB framework.
- Tournament rule: if the same game state occurs 3 times in a row, the game is a draw (don't implement this).
- If you can't move a piece anymore (i.e. you have none left / all are blocked) you lose the game.
- 10 minutes per player (only important for AI).
- All basic requirements = 6, everything else is bonus (especially transposition table).
- Experiments and plots are recommended.
- Mention failed experiments (bitboards, etc.)
