# Fianco

A small Java-based [Fianco](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/fianco.htm) implementation.

- If you can capture, you have to capture.
- Must use NegaMax AB framework.
- Tournament rule: if the same game state occurs 3 times in a row (player dependent), the game is a draw.
- 10 minutes per player (only important for AI).
- Moves should be denoted using chess notation (overlay recommended).
- Allow to start from certain state (recommended).
- Undo button (recommended).
- All basic requirements = 6, everything else is bonus (especially transposition table).
- Experiments and plots are recommended.
